## FrontEnd tech task for Alex
 - A lot of this was done under some serious lack of sleep, commented some areas that are a WIP.


## Endpoint
https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/bankalex/BankAlex-CodeTest/1.0.0#/developers/


## Instructions
```
$ npm install
$ npm run
```

## Tech used
#### React.js

- Some core libraries came in useful here, namely `useEffect` and `useState`. 
- useEffect mostly for fetching from the swagger endpoints

I considered adding Typescript or redux to the stack but eventually opted against it. 

There's a few libraries that would have sped progress up significantly, mostly in the realm of styling and representing JSON information- but in the spirit of showing my core understanding I decided to `not` use any third party libraries React.

Would have loved to give this a longer, broader shot but responsibilities in the real-world call unfortunately.
